* Melchior

This is meant to be an extremely simple static file server that
operates on the gemini protocol. I mostly just wanted an extremely
simple and hopfully secure server to run at home.

** Features

- Configured with environment variables

** Running

In order to run this, at the very least you'll need to generate a
certificate. I've been using a command like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout localhost.key -nodes -x509 -out localhost.crt -subj "/CN=localhost"
#+END_SRC

After getting the certificates generated you can run this by doing

#+BEGIN_SRC
env MELCHIOR_TLS_CERT=localhost.crt MELCHIOR_TLS_KEY=localhost.key MELCHIOR_HOSTNAME=localhost MELCHIOR_BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:1965 MELCHIOR_ROOT_DIR=. go run melchior.go
#+END_SRC

If you don't have a gemini client handy, you can use ~socat~ to do
some testing
#+BEGIN_SRC
socat - OPENSSL-connect:127.0.0.1:1965,verify=0
#+END_SRC
